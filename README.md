**_Description_:**

**_Project Goals:_**

**Customer Sentiment Analysis:** 
- There are higher number of negative sentiments than neutral or positive ones.
- If we dive deep into that, then as per the comparison of Csat score & Response time, the negative sentiment is highest among people with Billing questions.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Common customer complaints is Billing related queries.
- The channel through which the most payment queries are handled are Call centre so more workload is shared for Billing & Payment followups hence the increased response time.
- Hence distribution of customer query through proper channel is something they can work upon

**Service Response Time Analysis:** 
- LA team has response time within SLA which is highest amongst the dataset.
- Denver has lowest score for resp. time below SLA.
- So this builds up a picture that respective call centres will need to develop special case study wherein the efficiency of their service team can be improved & maintained in future.

- Based upon the dataset presented, the customers have been pragmatic about their approach in identifying the fastest means of resolution for their query which is call-centre, wherein most positive & very positive inputs have been resolved through.

**Trends and Patterns Identification:**
- To summarise, the trends & patterns within this dataset is something which I found to be of a research topic and honestly Nile needs to work upon their customer support services in a tech-savvy means such that their throughput can be improved & maintained.
