**_Project Goals:_**

**Customer Sentiment Analysis:** 
- There are higher number of negative sentiments than neutral or positive ones.
- If we dive deep into that, then as per the comparison of Csat score & Response time, the negative sentiment is highest among people with Billing questions.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Common customer complaints is Billing related queries.
- The channel through which the most payment queries are handled are Call centre so more workload is shared for Billing & Payment followups hence the increased response time.
- Hence distribution of customer query through proper channel is something they can work upon
